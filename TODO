* Monitor for changes and update the controls according to them:
   1) Add GHashTable for (track name => mixer widget) lookup
   2) Extend xfce_mixer_bus_message() to handle all types of messages
      by updating the corresponding mixer widgets

* Write panel plugin

* Write MCS plugin (or go the xfconf way)

* Allow changing controls from the console, probably via something like:
  --change-control=SOUNDCARD NAME:TRACK NAME:NEW VALUE

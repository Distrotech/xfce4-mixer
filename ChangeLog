	* configure.in.in, xfce4-mixer/xfce-mixer-card.{c,h},
	  xfce4-mixer/xfce-mixer.c: Add optional support for the GstMixer
	  notification API. It uses GstBus and GstMixerMessages. The latter
	  are only available with GStreamer >= 0.10.14. Not all work is done
	  yet, but it will be worked on this week.
	* autogen.sh: Tweak autogen.sh so that it works with both, SVN and
	  git-svn.

	* xfce4-mixer-card.{c,h}: Add XfceMixerCard class as a wrapper for
	  GstMixer. Implement a method (xfce_mixer_card_get_name()) to
	  work-around problems with sound card names containing characters
	  not allowed as section names (see Desktop Entry specification). 
	  This method is now used to store/load preferences of soundcards.
	* xfce4-mixer/xfce-mixer.{c,h}, 
	  xfce4-mixer/xfce-mixer-controls-dialog.{c,h}, 
	  xfce4-mixer/xfce-mixer-option.{c,h},
	  xfce4-mixer/xfce-mixer-switch.{c,h},
	  xfce4-mixer/xfce-mixer-track.{c,h}
	  xfce4-mixer/xfce-mixer-window.{c,h}: Use XfceMixerCard instead of
	  GstMixer everywhere. Change the main window subtitle to something
	  less enthusiastic.

	* xfce4-mixer/xfce-mixer-controls-dialog.c: Don't set the default
	  response of the dialog.

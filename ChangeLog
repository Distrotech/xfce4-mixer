2008-06-22	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* panel-plugin/xfce-mixer-plugin.c: Ignore GstBus messages
	  while applying changes to the active card/track to avoid
	  conflicting states.

2008-06-22	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* icons/: Revamp icons yet again.

2008-06-22	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* icons/scalable/*.svg: Update icons. I think they look better
	  this way.
	* panel-plugin/xfce-volume-button.c: Stop other "event-scroll"
	  handlers from being invoked after handling them inside the
	  volume button.

2008-06-22	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* panel-plugin/xfce-mixer-plugin.c: Add support for tooltips 
	  showing the currently used track and volume level in percent 
	  (e.g. 'Master: 50%').

2008-06-22	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* panel-plugin/xfce-volume-button.c: Preload icon pixbufs whenever
	  the icon size is changed.

2008-06-22	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* xfce4-mixer/xfce-mixer.c: Don't free the hash table keys as
	  they are owned by GStreamer. That introduced a really, really
	  weird bug ...
	* xfce4-mixer/xfce-mixer-track.c: Use 5% step size for all 
	  faders.

2008-06-22	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* xfce4-mixer/xfce-mixer-track.c: Fix crash when moving the 
	  fader of a mixer track with only one channel (which was 
	  caused by accessing the unitialized track->lock_button
	  variable).

2008-06-22	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* xfce4-mixer/xfce-mixer-track.{c,h},
	  xfce4-mixer/xfce-mixer-option.{c,h},
	  xfce4-mixer/xfce-mixer-switch.{c,h},
	  xfce4-mixer/xfce-mixer.c: Implement monitoring for mute,
	  record, volume, option and switch changes on all controls.
	  Works like a charm!

2008-06-21	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* libxfce4mixer/xfce-mixer-card.c: Mark cards as ready when
	  creating them. If the state is changed asynchroneously, wait
	  until the state change is done before returning from
	  xfce_mixer_card_set_state_ready().

2008-06-21	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* panel-plugin/xfce-volume-button.c: Remove the keyboard 
	  grabbing feature. It causes too much problems. People without
	  a mousewheel will have to click the plugin and use the real
	  mixer for now.

2008-06-21	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* libxfce4mixer/xfce-mixer-track-combo.c: Increment the counter
	  for determining the active track index only when playback
	  and capture tracks are found.

2008-06-21	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* panel-plugin/xfce-volume-button.{c,h}: Add "mute-toggled" 
	  signal for when the middle mouse button is clicked. Add 
	  xfce_volume_button_set_muted() method for manually changing
	  the mute state of the button (does not affect the actual sound
	  settings).
	* panel-plugin/xfce-mixer-plugin.c: Handle 
	  GST_MESSAGE_MUTE_TOGGLED messages by setting the muted state
	  of the plugin button.
	  
2008-06-21	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* panel-plugin/xfce-mixer-plugin.c: Add support for
	  xfce_mixer_card_connect() so that the volume button is updated
	  whenever the volume of the current mixer track is changed by
	  another program.
	* panel-plugin/xfce-mixer.c: Parse GST_MESSAGE_VOLUME_CHANGED
	  messages, but don't handle them yet. In the mixer it's much more
	  complicated than in the plugin, gonna do that later.

2008-06-21	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* icons/: Add volume level icons (1x muted, 5x different sound
	  wave icons). I'm not exactly satisfied, but it's better than
	  before.
	* libxfce4mixer/xfce-mixer-stock.{c,h}: Add support for the
	  icons mentioned above.
	* panel-plugin/xfce-mixer-plugin.c, 
	  panel-plugin/xfce-volume-button.c,
	  panel-plugin/xfce-plugin-dialog.c: (Hopefully) improve icon
	  scaling. Make sure (I guess) not to crash when the properties
	  dialog returns crap (why would it? heck, what do I know?).

2008-06-21	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* libxfce4mixer/xfce-mixer-track-combo.c: Fix a wrong 
	  if-statement in xfce_mixer_track_combo_set_track(). Now the
	  current mixer track should be preselected correctly when
	  opening the properties dialog of the plugin.

2008-06-21	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* panel-plugin/xfce-volume-button.c: Fix the button press
	  callback: Return TRUE when the middle button was pressed, 
	  return FALSE otherwise.

2008-06-21	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* panel-plugin/xfce-volume-button.c: Add support for toggling
	  between minimum and last known volume using the middle 
	  mouse button.

2008-06-21	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* panel-plugin/xfce-volume-button.c: Add support for GDK_Home
	  and GDK_End for changing the volume to the maximum/minimum
	  level.

2008-06-21	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* libxfce4mixer/Makefile.am, 
	  libxfce4mixer/xfce-mixer-card-combo.{c,h},
	  libxfce4mixer/xfce-mixer-track-combo.{c,h}, 
	  libxfce4mixer/xfce-mixer-utilities.{c,h}:
	  Add subclasses of GtkComboBox for unified selection of 
	  sound cards and mixer tracks. Add convenience functions for
	  getting a list of available sound cards and getting sound
	  cards by name. 
	* panel-plugin/Makefile.am,
	  panel-plugin/xfce-mixer-plugin.{c,h},
	  panel-plugin/xfce-plugin-dialog.{c,h},
	  panel-plugin/xfce-volume-button.{c,h}:
	  Implement the properties dialog of the plugin. By now it 
	  makes it possible to select which sound card and mixer track
	  to use. Also connect the plugin to GStreamer, so it actually 
	  does something. Add support for reading/writing the plugin 
	  configuration to the rc file. The volume button itself has
	  some focus grabbing problems: sometimes other windows don't
	  receive the focus even when the pointer leaves the button.
	* xfce4-mixer/xfce-mixer-window.c: Move the _load_soundcards 
	  method to the libxfce4mixer. Make use of the new 
	  XfceMixerCardCombo in XfceMixerWindow.

2008-06-19	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* panel-plugin/xfce-mixer-plugin.c: Try to start "xfce4-mixer" 
	  when the plugin button is clicked.

2008-06-19	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* Huge code reorganization: Split the mixer into three parts: 
	  libxfce4mixer, xfce4-mixer and the panel plugin. libxfce4mixer
	  contains everything that's needed by both, the mixer and the 
	  plugin.
	* panel-plugin/: This will become a minimalistic, keyboard and 
	  scroll-wheel orientated plugin with no volume popup slider or
	  whatsoever. I'll have to add this later. Still missing: config
	  dialog and the connection to the soundcard.
	* xfce4-mixer/: I don't think I've changed anything in here, just
	  reorganized the code.

2008-01-14	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* configure.in.in: Add support for version information, just like all
	  the other Xfce components have. Also add special debugging support
	  for SVN snapshots. Enhance the AC_COPYRIGHT value. Print build
	  configuration at the end of ./configure.

2008-01-14	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* configure.in.in, xfce4-mixer/xfce-mixer-card.{c,h},
	  xfce4-mixer/xfce-mixer.c: Add optional support for the GstMixer
	  notification API. It uses GstBus and GstMixerMessages. The latter
	  are only available with GStreamer >= 0.10.14. Not all work is done
	  yet, but it will be worked on this week.
	* autogen.sh: Tweak autogen.sh so that it works with both, SVN and
	  git-svn. 

2008-01-13	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* xfce4-mixer-card.{c,h}: Add XfceMixerCard class as a wrapper for
	  GstMixer. Implement a method (xfce_mixer_card_get_name()) to
	  work-around problems with sound card names containing characters
	  not allowed as section names (see Desktop Entry specification). 
	  This method is now used to store/load preferences of soundcards.
	* xfce4-mixer/xfce-mixer.{c,h}, 
	  xfce4-mixer/xfce-mixer-controls-dialog.{c,h}, 
	  xfce4-mixer/xfce-mixer-option.{c,h},
	  xfce4-mixer/xfce-mixer-switch.{c,h},
	  xfce4-mixer/xfce-mixer-track.{c,h}
	  xfce4-mixer/xfce-mixer-window.{c,h}: Use XfceMixerCard instead of
	  GstMixer everywhere. Change the main window subtitle to something
	  less enthusiastic. 

2008-01-13	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* xfce4-mixer/xfce-mixer-controls-dialog.c: Don't set the default
	  response of the dialog.

2008-01-13	Jannis Pohlmann <jannis@xfce.org>

	* Initial import of the new GStreamer-based mixer into trunk.

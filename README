This is a launcher with two states.

You use it like this:
	First, create a script which accepts these arguments:
		- none
			to check if on or off and output 0 or 1 (to stdout)

		- the value 1
			to set the state to on

		- the value 0
			to set the state to off

	If it can be used like this, its correct:
		$ blah/foo
		0
		$ blah/foo 1
		$ blah/foo
		1
		$ blah/foo 1
		$ blah/foo
		1
		$ blah/foo 0
		$ blah/foo
		0
		$ blah/foo 1
		$ blah/foo
		1

	Give this script to the launcher.

	Also two icons.

	And you are set ;)

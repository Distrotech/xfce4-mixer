xfce4-mixer Information
=======================

This package contains a volume control application based on GStreamer written
to conceptually fit into the Xfce desktop environment. It includes a plugin for
the Xfce panel.


Keyboard Shortcuts
------------------

The panel plugin optionally supports global keyboard shortcuts for raising and
lowering the volume, as well as muting the selected track if compiled against
libkeybinder. The plugin will then handle the XF86AudioRaiseVolume,
XF86AudioLowerVolume, and XF86AudioMute keyboard symbols.


Xfconf Configuration
--------------------

The mixer application supports the following properties in the xfce4-mixer
channel:

/window-width               width of the main window (integer)
/window-height              height of the main window width (integer)
/sound-card                 selected sound card (string)
/sound-cards/*              visible controls of a particular sound card (array
                            of strings)

The panel plugin supports the following properties:

sound-card                  selected sound card (string)
track                       selected track (sting)
command                     command which can be run from the plugin menu
                            (string)
enable-keyboard-shortcuts   enables or disables keyboard shortcuts (boolean)


Debugging
---------

Both the mixer application and the panel plugin have a builtin debugging mode
which will print additional diagnostic output useful for bug reports. For
xfce4-mixer it can be activated by specifying the --debug command line option,
diagnostic messages will be printed to stderr. For the panel plugin, please
follow the instructions at http://docs.xfce.org/xfce/xfce4-panel/debugging and
set the PANEL_DEBUG environment variable to "mixer", the disgnostic output can
then be found in the log file corresponding to the plugin.


Known Problems with GStreamer
-----------------------------

  * No sound card detected: if this happens you're probably missing a
    GStreamer plugin for your sound system. If you get this message on a Debian
    or Ubuntu system and you're using ALSA then installing gstreamer0.10-alsa
    should fix it. On OpenBSD installing gst-plugins-good might help.

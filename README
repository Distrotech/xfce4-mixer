This is xfce4-mixer, a volume control application for the Xfce Desktop
Environment. This software package contains both a volume control plugin
for the Xfce Panel and a standalone mixer application.

Currently, xfce4-mixer supports the following backends:

 * OSS - Open Sound System
   -----------------------
   Supported on Linux, FreeBSD (newpcm), NetBSD (libossaudio) and several
   other Unix-derivates.

 * SUN - Sun Audio
   ---------------
   Supported on Sun Solaris.
 
 * ALSA - Advanced Linux Sound Architecture
   ----------------------------------------
   Supported on newer Linux systems (2.4 and above).

You can select between the different backends using the configure option
--with-sound. If you don't specify this option, the configure script will
try to auto-detect the best backend for your system. For example, to
override the auto-detection and use ALSA, run configure like this:

 ./configure --with-sound=alsa

xfce4-mixer Information
=======================

This package contains a volume control application based on GStreamer
0.10 written to conceptually fit into the Xfce desktop environment. It
includes a plugin for the Xfce panel.


Debugging
---------

Both the mixer application and the panel plugin have a builtin debugging mode
which will print additional diagnostic output useful for bug reports. For
xfce4-mixer it can be activated by specifying the --debug command line option,
diagnostic messages will be printed to stderr. For the panel plugin, please
follow the instructions at http://docs.xfce.org/xfce/xfce4-panel/debugging and
set the PANEL_DEBUG environment variable to "mixer", the disgnostic output can
then be found in the log file corresponding to the plugin.


Known Problems with GStreamer
-----------------------------

  * No sound card detected: if this happens you're probably missing a
    GStreamer plugin for your sound system. If you get this message on a
    Debian or Ubuntu system and you're using ALSA then installing 
    gstreamer0.10-alsa should fix it. On OpenBSD installing 
    gst-plugins-good might help.
